# MegaAccountGenerator
Simple bash script to generate mega accounts using a self hosted mail server


You need to install tmux, mutt and megacmd (https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd)

Obviously you will need your self hosted mail, I reccommend docker-mailserver (https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver)


This script has been tested on Arch Linux
