# MegaAccountGenerator
Bash script to generate multiple mega accounts using a self hosted mail server

This script is also used to mount all generated accounts and merge them together in one mount


You need to install rclone, mergerfs, tmux, mutt and megacmd (https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd)

Obviously you will need your self hosted mail, I reccommend docker-mailserver (https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver) otherwise you will have to edit this script


This script has been tested on Arch Linux
